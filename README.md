# Moving-average-Filter

     A Moving Average Filter, also known as a running average filter, is a simple and widely used digital signal processing technique to smooth or reduce noise in time-series data. It calculates the average value of a series of data points over a specific window or interval and replaces the original data points with the computed average. This helps to eliminate short-term fluctuations or high-frequency noise while preserving the overall trend or pattern in the data.
